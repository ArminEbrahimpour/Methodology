    # for subdomain discovery https://columbus.elmasy.com/api/lookup/ford.com

    # https://github.com/gwen001/gitlab-subdomains 
 
    # google dork for finding subdomains  (site:crunchbase.com "acquired by Walmart")


    # first use dnsx then use httpx for more speed

    # httpx updated a new switch which catch screenshot and there is no need for eyewitness

    # befor using httpx you could use dnsx which can speed up your process

    # Subdomain TakeOver:
        the most impacful thing is to takeover the nameserver in that case we can redirect any
        client to the IP we wanted 

        # tools
            subjack and dnsReaper

            subjack is older and it's fingerprint is older and we could use the fingerprints of https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz 
            but you need to change that into the array for subjack to use them




    # directory fuzzing

    # sourosh dalili built a tool for IIS which https://github.com/irsdl/IIS-ShortName-Scanner this is a great tool


    # crawling (katana and gobuster) katana is very great tool for finding things and it has so many feathers you could use 

    # fingerPrinting web Application 
        # server header disclosure
        # errors
        # tools like : WhatWeb,Webanalyzer,Wapplyzer

        # what web could get some issues which you could use these commands :
                sudo apt install libyaml-dev
                sudo apt update
                sudo apt install ruby-full

                # Install Bundler
                sudo gem install bundler

        # if the web is using jquery in console $().jquery something like this


    # what is the difference between cve and cwe ?
        cwe is kolli tare 
        cve is more specific 

    # serachexploit tool is used for serching after finding applications and those versions and read about them 
    # another tool is cvemap which is something like the searchexploit
    #   mitre cve database
        and some more which is in the notion of miniblue team

    # vulnerability scanning 
        # nuclei

            # or for using fuzzing mode we need to use dast switch

            # more usable switches for nuclei :
                -id 
                -tags
                -as   # for detecting before testing
